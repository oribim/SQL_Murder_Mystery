A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it.
You vaguely remember that the crime was a ​murder​ that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018​ and that it took place in SQL City.

-- We can start by retrieving the crime scene report table from the police department’s database.
  
SELECT * FROM crime_scene_report
 
-- The query above allows us view the data contained in this table and lets us know what we have available to work with. 
-- The result from the above query retrieves a table containing ( date integer, type text, description text, city text )
-- We vaguely remember the type of crime, date and city in which it occured. With these we can apply a WHERE clause filter
  
SELECT * 
FROM crime_scene_report
WHERE date = '20180115' and type = 'murder' and city = 'SQL City'

-- Only one entry exists with the above query. The description states: Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses. The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr". The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave".
-- We can use the query below to determine the name of the first witness from the person table.

SELECT * FROM person
WHERE address_street_name like 'Northwestern Dr'
ORDER BY address_number desc  
-- The last house on Northwestern drive belongs to Morty Schapiro with ID number 14887.

SELECT * FROM person
WHERE address_street_name like 'Franklin Ave' and name like 'Annabel'
-- The second witness is Annabel Miller with ID 16371

-- We can pull up the transcripts for both witness interviews
SELECT pers.id, pers.name, intv.transcript 
FROM person pers
JOIN interview intv
ON pers.id=intv.person_id
WHERE pers.id = 14887 or pers.id = 16371

-- Morty Schapiro: I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".
-- Annabel Miller:	I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th.
-- From the witness statements, we can deduce that the killer was at the gym on January 9th 2018 and is a gold member at "Get Fit Now Gym" who drives a car with a license plate that includes "H42W".

SELECT person_id, id, name
FROM get_fit_now_member
WHERE membership_status = 'gold' and id like '48Z__' 
-- We have our 2 prime suspects "Joe Germuska" and "Jeremy Bowers".

-- We know our murder suspect drives a car with a license plate that includes "H42W". We can pull up the car details for our key suspects from the drivers_license table.
SELECT pers.id, pers.name, pers.license_id, dlic.plate_number
FROM person pers
JOIN drivers_license dlic
ON pers.license_id=dlic.id
WHERE pers.id LIKE '67318' and '28819'

-- Jeremy Bowers drives a car with the partial plate number identified by our first witness.
-- We can confirm by checking if Jeremy Bowers was at the gym on January 9th 2018 as seen by our second witness.
SELECT gfnci.membership_id, gfnci.check_in_date, gfnm.name, gfnm.membership_status
FROM get_fit_now_check_in gfnci
JOIN get_fit_now_member gfnm

WHERE gfnci.check_in_date = '20180109'

-- It's confirmed. Jeremy Bowers was at the gym on the 9th of January, is a gold member at the gym, and his membership id and plate number match our witness descriptions.
-- Jeremy Bowers is the murderer!!!
-- In his interview he says: I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"). She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017.
-- But who is this woman?

SELECT pers.name, fbec.person_id, COUNT(fbec.person_id) AS number_of_times_attended, fbec.event_name
FROM facebook_event_checkin fbec

WHERE fbec.event_name = 'SQL Symphony Concert'
AND fbec.date like '201712__'
GROUP BY fbec.person_id
ORDER BY number_of_times_attended desc
-- Two people attended the Symphony 3 times in December 2017: "Bryan Pardo" and "Miranda Priestly" with ID: 24556 and 99716 respectively.
-- We can further confirm by checking whose car details conform with Jeremy's statement.

SELECT pers.id, pers.name, dlic.hair_color, dlic.height, dlic.car_make, dlic.car_model
FROM person pers
JOIN drivers_license dlic
ON pers.license_id=dlic.id
WHERE pers.id = 24556 
or pers.id = 99716

-- It's a match. Miranda Priestly hired our killer!!
